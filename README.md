<h1>Description</h1>
*HTML TAG*<br>
main: represents the main content of a web page, typically containing the unique and primary content of the page.<br>
header: defines a container for introductory or navigational content at the top of a web page or section, often including elements like logos and navigation menus.<br>
section: defines a thematic grouping of content within a web page, allowing you to structure related content together, such as articles, blog posts, or distinct sections of a page.<br><br>
Here I use OWL Carousel : 
OWL Carousel is a popular and responsive jQuery carousel/slider plugin that allows you to create customizable and interactive carousels or sliders for displaying content like images, videos, or any other HTML elements on your website. It's named "OWL" because it was inspired by the behavior of an owl rotating its head to look around.<br><br>

*CSS Properties*  
CSS Grid:<br>
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system in CSS that enables the creation of complex grid-based layouts with rows and columns. It's used to structure content in a grid format and allows for precise control over the placement and alignment of items within the grid.<br><br>

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout):<br>
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system in CSS designed for aligning and distributing items within a container along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). It simplifies the arrangement of content in a linear fashion and is particularly useful for building responsive and evenly spaced layouts.<br><br>

MediaQuery:<br>
A media query in CSS is a conditional statement that allows you to apply specific styles to HTML elements based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen width, height, device type, or orientation. It enables the creation of responsive web designs by tailoring the presentation of content to different viewing conditions, ensuring a better user experience across various devices and screen sizes.<br><br>

Hover Effect:<br>
A hover effect is a visual change or animation applied to an element (typically a link or a button) when a user hovers their cursor over it. This effect provides feedback to the user, indicating that the element is interactive. Common hover effects include color changes, underlines, and animations, enhancing the interactivity and user experience of a website or application.<br><br>

**Explaining Enent and Sport UI**

**{
1. **Container Styles**: 
   - `.container` styles set a maximum width, margin, and flex display for containers. It creates a layout with a maximum width of 1230px and horizontal spacing between elements.

2. **Header Styles**:
   - `header` styles add a margin at the bottom of the header element.

3. **Aside and Main Styles**:
   - `aside` styles define the width for an aside element (25% of the parent container).
   - `main` styles define the width for the main content area (74% of the parent container).

4. **Button Styles**:
   - `.buttons button` styles define the appearance of buttons. They have specific styles like color, background color, border-radius, and padding.
   - 5. **Gallery Styles**:
   - `.gallery` styles format a grid layout for a gallery section with specified column and row gaps.

6. **Box Styles**:
   - `.box1` styles define the appearance of boxes within the gallery section, including cursor style, image width, and text styles.

7. **Full Styles**:
   - `.full` and related styles format a full-width content section with specified text and background colors.

8. **Container2 Styles**:
   - `.cont2` and `.container2` styles provide styling for a specific container element.

9. **Text Styles**:
   - Styles like `.cont2 h4`, `.cont2 p`, and `.ps1` define font styles, sizes, and colors for text elements.

10. **Filter Styles**:
    - Styles like `.main_containerr`, `.containerr`, and `.bbutton` create a filterable content section with expandable containers.
11. **Button Group Styles**:
    - `.bbuttons`, `.bbuttons2`, and `.bbuttons4` styles format groups of buttons with specific layouts.

12. **Browse Button Styles**:
    - `.browse` styles format a browse button with specific colors and dimensions.
   
 # In this CSS code, there are several media queries that apply different styles based on the screen width:

1. **Mobile and Small Screens (320px to 768px)**:
   - Elements like `.nav_1`, `.nav_2`, and `footer` are hidden.
   - A fixed navigation bar with the class `.navbar_event` is introduced at the top of the screen.
   - Various elements within `.event_nav` and `.event_nav2` are styled differently.
   - Header margin is adjusted for spacing.
   - Some elements within `aside` and `main h2` are hidden.
   - Special styling is applied to buttons and containers for this screen size.

2. **Medium Screens (769px to 1022px)**:
   - Similar to the mobile/small screen styles but with some adjustments.
   - The header's margin is reduced.
   - Elements within `.event_nav2` are adjusted.
   - A pair of buttons (`left` and `right`) are introduced and styled.
3. **Large Screens (1022px and above)**:
   - Elements like `.navbar_event` and `.two_buttons` are hidden.
   - Styles for larger screens, including adjustments to `.nav_1`, `.nav_2`, and `.container`.
   - `.gallery` layout is adjusted for larger screens.
   - Adjustments to `.container2`, `.cont2`, and other elements.

These media queries help in creating responsive design for different screen sizes, ensuring that the layout and styling adapt appropriately to provide the best user experience.

<h1>Description</h1>
For ICC MEN I have taken two sections the first section contain the all image of the pages.
The second section contain the path of the page.The third section contain the despription.
And finally the third section is the footer part.
I also tried to make it responsive as possible.
In the first section I make it display as flex and change the flex direction to column.
In side it some img tag and h tag are used.
The Flag part and State part is made of grid property.
The are divide in 3-columns and 4-rows. By grid-templetes-rows/columns properties.
The footer part is contain of svg tag and many of a tag to complete with some hover property when hover change its color to white.
At last I have taken some Icon from Aswomefonts  and also given some hover property.
To make it responsive i use 3-4 break point with apply @media only screen and (-----) properties.
