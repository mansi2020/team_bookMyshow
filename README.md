<h1>Description</h1>
*HTML TAG*<br>
main: represents the main content of a web page, typically containing the unique and primary content of the page.<br>
header: defines a container for introductory or navigational content at the top of a web page or section, often including elements like logos and navigation menus.<br>
section: defines a thematic grouping of content within a web page, allowing you to structure related content together, such as articles, blog posts, or distinct sections of a page.<br><br>
Here I use OWL Carousel : 
OWL Carousel is a popular and responsive jQuery carousel/slider plugin that allows you to create customizable and interactive carousels or sliders for displaying content like images, videos, or any other HTML elements on your website. It's named "OWL" because it was inspired by the behavior of an owl rotating its head to look around.<br><br>

*CSS Properties*  
CSS Grid:<br>
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system in CSS that enables the creation of complex grid-based layouts with rows and columns. It's used to structure content in a grid format and allows for precise control over the placement and alignment of items within the grid.<br><br>

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout):<br>
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system in CSS designed for aligning and distributing items within a container along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). It simplifies the arrangement of content in a linear fashion and is particularly useful for building responsive and evenly spaced layouts.<br><br>

MediaQuery:<br>
A media query in CSS is a conditional statement that allows you to apply specific styles to HTML elements based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen width, height, device type, or orientation. It enables the creation of responsive web designs by tailoring the presentation of content to different viewing conditions, ensuring a better user experience across various devices and screen sizes.<br><br>

Hover Effect:<br>
A hover effect is a visual change or animation applied to an element (typically a link or a button) when a user hovers their cursor over it. This effect provides feedback to the user, indicating that the element is interactive. Common hover effects include color changes, underlines, and animations, enhancing the interactivity and user experience of a website or application.<br><br>

   - Special styling is applied to buttons and containers for this screen size.

   - Similar to the mobile/small screen styles but with some adjustments.
   - The header's margin is reduced.
   - Elements within `.event_nav2` are adjusted.
